# The latency corresponds to the delay in seconds between the current time at which the observation
# is fed to the policy to compute the next action, and the next action being sent to the controller.
# Note: For simulation environments, there could be no latency, but for real-world, latency is usually
# set to `1 / fps` to account for the runtime of the policy (which is often lower than `1 / fps`) and then
# a forced sleep to reach `+ 1 / fps` from current observation time.
